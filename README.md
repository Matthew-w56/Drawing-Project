# Intro

This is an Android application that I wrote with a team as part of a course I completed at the University of Utah on Mobile Development.
It allows for basic drawing, different tools and colors, and saving/loading data to/from a Firebase firestore (with authentication).

# Plans

I plan to get back to this project at some point and refine the codebase, refactor it's structure, and improve upon it's features.
