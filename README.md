# Intro

This is an Android application that I wrote with a team as part of a course I completed at the University of Utah on Mobile Development.
It allows for basic drawing, different tools and colors, and saving/loading data to/from a Firebase firestore (with authentication).

## Technologies

This project leverages a number of technologies and techniques.  Here are a few of them:
- C++ Integration through the JNI
- Firebase Integration through API calls
- Jetpack Compose
- Android-Native View-based Structure and Navigation
- Account management and authentication through Firebase

Most of the application is written in Kotlin, with the exception of the C++ code for image manipulation tasks such as
image blur, and color inverting.  This code was written by us.

## Plans

I plan to get back to this project at some point and refine the codebase, refactor it's structure, and improve upon it's features.
